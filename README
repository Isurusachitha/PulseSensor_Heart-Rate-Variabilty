This repo contains Processing Sketches that explore Heart Rate Variability (HRV).

These sketches work with Arduino running Pulse Sensor BPM code and plugged into PulseSensor hardware. You can find a tutorial on how to get your Arduino set up to read the Pulse Sensor signal and output data to these sketches here
